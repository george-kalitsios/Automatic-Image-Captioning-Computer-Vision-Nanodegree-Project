# Project-Automatic-Image-Captioning
Computer Vision Nanodegree Automatic Image Captioning


In this project, I design and train a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) model for automatically generating image captions. The network is trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset. The image captioning model is displayed below.

**Notebook 3 : Validating the model and Do some fun with it**

**Generating Image Captions**
**Here are some predictions from my model.**
